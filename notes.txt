BUILDING INTELLIGENT CHATBOT

- Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to understand the attitudes, opinions, and emotions; it includes positive, negative, or neutral. 

- NLP: It stands for Natural Language Processing which is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. 


-Entity Recognition: Entity recognition, also known as named entity recognition (NER), is a natural language processing task that involves identifying and categorizing key information (entities) within a text, such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and other specific types of information

ALGORITHM

1. Define the objectives of the chatbot and its purpose. 

2. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather data of user queries and corresponding responses and use it to train the model.

3.Data pre processing and cleaning which includes text normalization, tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatization, Part of speech tagging. 


4.  Use NLP Techniques: Select NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization based on the requirements of the chatbot.

5.  Choose a suitable framework or library for NLP development, such as TensorFlow.js, based on the project's requirements

6.. Implement and train the chatbot
- Select a development platform
- Implement the NLP Technique
- Train the chatbot
Ensure to build and train the NLP model using the selected framework. 


7. Implement Sentiment Analysis: Integrate sentiment analysis techniques to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and understand the emotional tone of user queries and provide appropriate responses.

8. Incorporate Entity Recognition: Implement entity recognition to identify and extract specific entities such as names, dates, and locations from user queries.

9.  Develop logic to generate context-aware responses based on the context of the conversation. This could involve maintaining conversation history, tracking user intent, and generating appropriate responses using rule-based or machine learning-based approaches.

9. Testing and Evaluation: Test the chatbot with a variety of queries to ensure that it accurately understands and responds to user input. Evaluate its performance and make adjustments as needed.

10. Deployment: Deploy your chatbot to a suitable platform or environment where users can interact with it.

##ABOUT THE DATA
The dataset available is a comprehensive collection of conversations related to mental health. It encompasses various conversation types, including basic exchanges, frequently asked questions about mental health, classical therapy discussions, and general advice given to individuals facing anxiety and depression.
So we are training the chatbot model to emulate a therapist. We are building chatbots capable of providing emotional support to individuals experiencing anxiety and depression.
